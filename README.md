### How do I get set up? ###

* download the PyNGL library from https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Download/ then place in site-packages of python distro. This library only works with linux and macOS
* 
* if an import error is encountered during the Ngl import, that is searching for the libgfortran.so.3 library (or something similar?) this is related to the gcc version or direction.  A 'conda install gcc' should redirect proper paths/versions to interact with the Ngl library properly

     * download and add to python path by:
     * import sys
     * sys.path.append('path/to/library/')
     * import sblib as sb
