title: Beach and Nearshore Surveys at the USACE, Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC
summary: >
  Repetitive surveys of shore-perpendicular profile lines surrounding the USACE Field Research Facility
  (FRF) in Duck, NC (600 m to the north and 600 m to the south of the research pier).  Surveys are typically
  monthly but can increase in both temporal and spatial coverage during experiments.  Profile lines are spaced 
  45m apart and extend from the primary dune to approximately 2km offshore(-15m isobath NAVD88). 
  Survey points are obtained using a variety of techniques (evolving through time) including;rod and level, Miniranger, Zeiss, Geodimeter,
  and Trimble RTK GPS system combined with a survey grade echosounder and optionally, a motion sensor.  
  These components are mounted on one of the following platforms; Lighter Amphibious Resupply Cargo V (LARC-V) vessel, the coastal research amphibious 
  buggy (CRAB),or a Sea Sled that is towed by a vessel. All surveying platforms are capable of continuous data collection from the
  beach, through the surf zone and offshore. Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) are measured at the
  end of the FRF pier to a depth of -7 m on the day of survey in order to determine the speed of sound in
  the water column.  Data points are collected on average every 2.5 m. Topographic (TOPO) survey points of
  the beach and dune, above the elevation reached by the LARC-V, are periodically collected. Since changes in the dune occur less frequently than does the beach and
  offshore, TOPO points may be added from an earlier time period.
history: >
  These data are part of a series of surveys since October 1974, designed to document the evolving 
  beach topography and bathymetry surrounding the USACE Field Research Facility (FRF) and to measure its 
  response to coastal processes, including storms.  Survey data are complemented by a suite of continuous
  observations of local waves, winds, tides and currents.  These data are unique in their temporal 
  coverage and vertical accuarcy and have been the subject of multiple technical papers.

processing: >
  Hypack, Inc.'s Hypack software guides the survey platforms along 
  the profile lines and logs the data. Processing software consists of Fathomax, a custom FORTRAN routine that 
  works on both the CRAB and LARC survey platforms. For the LARC, Fathomax dynamically synchronizes the 
  GPS, echosounder, and motion sensor data in order to remove the motion of the vessel due to waves. 
  This is accomplished by adjusting the latency between the GPS and the echosounder data streams until 
  the influence of the wave motion is minimized, and a best fit is obtained. The survey software also
  adjusts depths for the speed of sound and converts geographic coordinates to the local FRF coordinate 
  system. For the CRAB, Fathomax subtracts the elevation of the tripod and accounts for tilt in steep areas
  by a sloper iterative technique. Data collection and processing is done using Microsoft Windows-based computers. Data file size
  varies from 70-3,300 kb depending on the number or profile lines included in the survey.
